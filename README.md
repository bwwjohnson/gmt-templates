# gmt-templates

Intended as a backup for me, and perhaps a starting point for people looking to do similar things with gmt. 

--- gps_profile_template.sh
- projects GNSS velocities and errors onto profile-parallel and profile-perpendicular plots
- does a hacky job of displaying fault intersections on the profile (intended as a messy working solution, not for presentation)
- has some commented out lines which plot profile lines and end-points on an associated map
--- plot_beachball_gps
- template for making a topo map in GMT v6+ and plotting focal mechanisms and GPS vectors
